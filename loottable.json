"Go to https://darkanddarker.wiki.spellsandguns.com/Monsters and only regard the monsters that are in the maps Crypt or Inferno (Do not do Mimic)"
"Open the first monster, scroll to the bottom, select a specific container (common, elite, nightmare, misc, high roller misc, etc.) and copy the entire loot table into the JSON file."
"If the item has multiple potential rolls, such as different amounts of gold, take the average and round it to the nearest coin, and add up all the percentages."
"Type the exact percentage number without the percent symbol."
"Above the loot table, there will be a statistic showing the number of rolls. Make sure to include that value. Include the potential for nothing as well."
