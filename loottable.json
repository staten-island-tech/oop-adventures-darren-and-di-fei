"Open the first monster, scroll to the bottom, select a specific container (common, elite, nightmare, misc, high roller misc, etc.) and copy the entire loot table into the JSON file."

"Type the exact percentage number without the percent symbol."
"Above the loot table, there will be a statistic showing the number of rolls. Make sure to include that value. Include the potential for nothing as well."
